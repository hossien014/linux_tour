# Fully uninstall app 

for example you want to uninstall postgresql 
To fully uninstall PostgreSQL from your Linux system, you can follow these steps. The commands may vary slightly depending on your Linux distribution, so be sure to adapt them as needed for your specific system:

1. **Stop the PostgreSQL Service**:

   First, stop the PostgreSQL service to ensure that it's not running:

   ```bash
   sudo service postgresql stop
   ```

   Or:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop postgresql
   ```

2. **Remove PostgreSQL Packages**:

   Use your package manager to remove PostgreSQL and its related packages. The package name may vary depending on your Linux distribution. Here are some examples:

   - For Ubuntu/Debian:

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get remove --purge postgresql postgresql-contrib
     ```  
      [read more about this command below](#what-this-command-do-sudo-apt-get-remove---purge-postgresql-postgresql-contrib)
   - For CentOS/RHEL:

     ```bash
     sudo yum remove postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
     ```

   - For openSUSE:

     ```bash
     sudo zypper remove postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
     ```

3. **Delete PostgreSQL Data Directory**:

   After uninstalling PostgreSQL packages, the data directory is usually not removed. If you want to completely remove PostgreSQL, including the data, you can delete the data directory. The data directory location can typically be found in the PostgreSQL configuration file, `postgresql.conf`. Common locations include `/var/lib/pgsql/data/`, `/var/lib/postgresql/data/`, or `/usr/local/pgsql/data/`. Use the appropriate command to remove the data directory:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -r /var/lib/pgsql/data/
   ```

   Replace the directory path with the actual data directory path you found on your system.

4. **Remove PostgreSQL User**:

   By default, PostgreSQL creates a system user named "postgres." To remove this user, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo deluser postgres
   ```

5. **Remove PostgreSQL Configuration Files**:

   Although you've uninstalled PostgreSQL and deleted the data directory, there may be some lingering configuration files. Use the following command to remove any remaining PostgreSQL configuration files:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /etc/postgresql/
   ```

6. **Clean Up PostgreSQL Dependencies**:

   To remove any residual dependencies and configuration files related to PostgreSQL, use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get autoremove
   ```

   For CentOS/RHEL:

   ```bash
   sudo yum autoremove
   ```

   For openSUSE:

   ```bash
   sudo zypper clean
   ```

7. **Verify Uninstallation**:

   To ensure that PostgreSQL is fully uninstalled, check for any remaining PostgreSQL-related files and directories:

   ```bash
   dpkg -l | grep postgres   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   rpm -qa | grep postgres   # For CentOS/RHEL
   ```

   If there are no remaining PostgreSQL-related packages, the uninstallation is successful.

Please be cautious when running these commands, and double-check the package names, data directory location, and paths to ensure that they match your system. The commands may differ based on your specific Linux distribution and PostgreSQL version.

If you no longer need these configuration files and are sure that you don't have any data or settings you want to keep, you can safely remove the residual configuration files using the following command:

```bash
sudo dpkg -P --force-all postgresql-14 postgresql-client-common postgresql-common
```

This command will purge the configuration files of the specified packages, ensuring that all traces of PostgreSQL are removed from your system.

Please exercise caution when using the `--force-all` option, as it can forcefully remove configuration files without further confirmation. Double-check that you have backups of any essential data or settings, and ensure you don't need any of the PostgreSQL-related files before proceeding with this command.

## what is dpkg
`dpkg` is the Debian Package Manager for Debian-based Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. It is a command-line tool for managing packages on a Debian-based system. `dpkg` is used to install, configure, update, and remove software packages in these systems.

Here are some common `dpkg` commands and their uses:

1. **Install a Package**: You can use `dpkg` to install a Debian package (`.deb` file) with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i package.deb
   ```

2. **Remove a Package**: To uninstall a package, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -r package
   ```

   This removes the package but retains its configuration files.

3. **Purge a Package**: To completely remove a package, including its configuration files, use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg --purge package
   ```

4. **List Installed Packages**: To list all installed packages, you can use:

   ```bash
   dpkg --list
   ```

5. **Query Information about a Package**: To get detailed information about a specific package, use:

   ```bash
   dpkg --status package
   ```

6. **Search for a Package**: You can search for a package by name using:

   ```bash
   dpkg -l | grep package
   ```

7. **Reconfigure a Package**: If a package's configuration is broken, you can reconfigure it using:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg-reconfigure package
   ```

8. **View Package Contents**: To list the files included in a package, you can use:

   ```bash
   dpkg --contents package.deb
   ```

9. **Check Dependencies**: To check package dependencies, you can use:

   ```bash
   dpkg -I package.deb
   ```

`dpkg` is a low-level package manager, and it works with individual packages. It doesn't resolve dependencies automatically, which means you might need to handle dependency management manually in some cases. For this reason, it's often used in conjunction with higher-level package management tools like `apt` (Advanced Package Tool) on Debian-based systems. `apt` is a more user-friendly front-end to `dpkg` that takes care of dependency resolution and simplifies package management tasks.

## what this command do "sudo apt-get remove --purge postgresql postgresql-contrib" 

The command `sudo apt-get remove --purge postgresql postgresql-contrib` is used to remove the PostgreSQL database management system and its associated components from an Ubuntu or Debian-based Linux system. Let's break down the command and its components:

- `sudo`: It is used to run the subsequent command as a superuser, which is required for making system-wide changes like package installation or removal.

- `apt-get`: It is a package management tool used in Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu) to handle packages. It can be used for installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages.

- `remove`: This is the action specified for `apt-get`. It instructs `apt-get` to remove packages from the system.

- `--purge`: The `--purge` option is used to remove not only the package but also its configuration files. This ensures that all traces of the package are deleted, including any configuration files and data files associated with it.

- `postgresql`: This is the package name for the PostgreSQL database management system.

- `postgresql-contrib`: This is an additional package that includes various contributed extensions and modules for PostgreSQL.

When you run this command, it will remove the PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL-contrib packages, along with their associated configuration files and data, effectively uninstalling PostgreSQL from your system.

Keep in mind that using `--purge` will delete the data and configuration files. If you have valuable data in your PostgreSQL databases, make sure to back up your data before running this command to avoid data loss.

## what is the different between dpkg and apt-get package managers?
`apt-get` and `dpkg` are both package management tools used in Debian-based Linux distributions, but they serve different purposes and have distinct features:

1. **`dpkg` (Debian Package Manager)**:

   `dpkg` is the lower-level package management tool in Debian-based systems, including Ubuntu. It is used for the low-level operations of installing, configuring, and removing individual packages. Some of the common tasks you can perform with `dpkg` include:

   - Installing a specific `.deb` package file.
   - Listing installed packages.
   - Removing packages.
   - Querying package information.
   - Extracting files from a package.
   - Verifying package integrity.
   - Managing package triggers.

   `dpkg` itself does not handle dependency resolution. It works with individual package files and doesn't automatically download and install packages from repositories. It's typically used by higher-level package managers like `apt-get` and `apt` to perform package installations, and it doesn't manage repositories or package updates.

2. **`apt-get` and `apt` (Advanced Package Tool)**:

   `apt-get` and `apt` are higher-level package management tools built on top of `dpkg`. They are responsible for handling package management tasks such as resolving and installing dependencies, fetching packages from repositories, and managing the overall system package database. Here's a brief explanation of each:

   - **`apt-get`**: It is a command-line tool that provides a convenient interface for interacting with packages, repositories, and system updates. It can download packages and install them, resolve dependencies, and handle package removal. It's widely used for managing software packages in Debian-based systems.

   - **`apt`**: `apt` is a newer command-line tool that serves as a more user-friendly interface to the APT package management system. It provides a simpler and more consistent set of commands compared to `apt-get` while offering the same package management capabilities.

In summary, `dpkg` is the lower-level package manager responsible for package installations and management on a per-package basis, while `apt-get` and `apt` are higher-level package managers that provide a more user-friendly and comprehensive package management experience, including dependency resolution and system-wide package management. Typically, users interact with `apt-get` or `apt` for day-to-day package management tasks in Debian-based systems.
